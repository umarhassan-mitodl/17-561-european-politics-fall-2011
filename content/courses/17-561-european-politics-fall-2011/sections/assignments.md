The final grade in this course will be based on the following:

### Class Participation

Please come to class having read the material and ready with questions that you would like to discuss.

### Current Events

Periodically some subset of students will be asked to make short oral reports (5–10 mins.) on some current event or issue within the countries being discussed in class at that time. Students will be asked in advance and those who are reporting need not do extensive research. However, it is asked that you consult a minimum of two to three sources so that you have the story from a couple of different "angles." In addition, students should go beyond purely US-based materials and use at least one European source. Students who read Italian, German, or French might consult one of the major news magazines or newspapers from those countries; otherwise, you can use British materials, including sources like _The Economist_.

The reports should relate the news you are reporting with reference to themes in the course. Please choose subjects that have some depth and are worth discussing, and come to class with the list of sources on which you drew for your presentation.

### Written Assignments

There will be two written assignments, of 9–10 pages each. These will be responses to essay questions (usually two) that the professor will distribute approximately 10 days in advance. Your papers/essays should draw on readings (as well as discussion and lecture material) to provide well thought-out and well organized answers.
