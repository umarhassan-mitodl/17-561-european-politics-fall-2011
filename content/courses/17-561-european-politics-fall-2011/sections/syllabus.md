Course Description
------------------

This course deals with the organization of political power and the dynamics of political change in four major European countries: Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. We will focus especially on the structure of political power within the state and on important institutions that form the link between state and society (especially political parties and interest organizations).

The organization of political power within the state and society vary across our four countries in ways that reflect divergent outcomes of previous political conflicts. We will review critical aspects of the historical development of each country that sent them along different "paths," to understand how political power becomes entrenched in particular institutions. However, most of the course will focus on the contemporary institutions of political governance and current political developments in each country.
